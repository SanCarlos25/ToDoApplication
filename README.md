## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This project was my introduction to using Android studio and Kotlin. There was a small learning curve but a great satisfactio
when the code worked together. I had trouble using git because there was no connecion between my local and remote repositories but
it was a simple fix!
